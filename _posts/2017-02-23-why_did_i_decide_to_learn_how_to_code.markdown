As Neil Gaiman says, “Perfection is like chasing the horizon. Keep moving.” I couldn't agree more with Neil. 

So decided to learn to code for a simple reason, to chase the horizon! 


Although I am an avid user of modern technology, I have never thought I would be pursuing a career in programming. 

I am from Brazil, a mom, and coffee lover. I have been in the fashion industry for about 4 years. Although the fashion industry is a lot of fun; lately, I have been less excited about where I am now in my career and and feel it has stagnated. Today I am ready to make changes, look for new opportunities in life and create beautiful things that may one day help others to succeed in life and make a better world.

My interests in coding started a years ago when I decided to create a webite for fun. I had so much fun creating a website with the help of "Wix". I would spend hours working on the website and every detail was so important to me.  Surprisingly, I had great feedback from friends and family. So I thought to myself, why not learn how to code. It will be nice to figure out in detail what's going on under the surface of a web page. 

So I started looking for free classes online and I came across Codecademy. I started playing around with HTML and Javascript and realized that I really enjoyed solving the problems. I see coding like a puzzle and every piece is very important so you can see the big picture. Seeing everything coming to life is so rewarding. 

I knew that the most effective way to learn something new was to dive in and immerse myself. I heard great things about bootcamps and I thought would be great way to fit learning into my hectic schedule. So I applied for Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep. I started learning some Ruby, and I now started the Online Web Developer Program. I am so excited to finally dedicate the time to learn something I really enjoy doing. 

I can’t wait to learn more and more, and make coding part of my future. While I hate to date myself, I remember dial-up modems all too well. It is amazing to see how technology is changing at an ever increasing pace, with coding playing a major role. I can't wait to see the improvements and contributions that coding will make in the coming decade. I look forward to being a part of it.

I believe coding doesn’t have to be an overwhelming experience even though there is a lot to learn. Thus, on my blog, I want to show how to code in a simple way and the process of self-teaching. I am looking forward to learning and code away with some new friends. 

I hope to see you soon.
