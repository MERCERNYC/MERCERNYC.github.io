So far I am very happy to see my my Tic Tac toe board working and taking shape.

I realized that to create TTT board wasnâ€™t as simple as I initially thought and to solve the labs can be frustrating sometimes specially for us beginners.

But whenever I have a question, the Flatiron community is great, and help me anytime I am stuck. 

Storing an element with array which can hold a collection of values and retrieving it with interpolation was an important content to grasp in order for me to solve some labs.

Elements in an array [ ] are associated with a number that represents their order. This number is called an
index. 

So, for example, to retrieve the first variable from an array you can use array[0], and to retrieve the second you can use array[1] and so on.

Let's see the Display_rainbow lab as an example:

```
1. Define a method, display_rainbow
2. display_rainbow must accept an argument, an array of colors. 
3. display_rainbow should print out the colors of the rainbow in the following format: R: red, O: orange, Y: yellow, G: green, B: blue, I: indigo, V: violet by reading from the array passed in as an argument. 
```

The rainbow lab example is perfect to example to show that a string (`#{}`) interpolation can occur in the beginning, end, or somewhere in the middle of a string.

This method can be used with Tic Tac Toe board  as well. You will have store elements into an array and retrieve the elements with interpolation to print player tokens X or 0.

Moreover, using a string interpolation can help you to keep your code clean and easy to read.

I hope these tips can help you to solve some labs.

Tchau!
