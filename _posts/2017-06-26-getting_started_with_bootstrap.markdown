How about more time to spend with your friends instead of breaking your head to create responsive webpages? The solution is to be best friend of the framework called Bootstrap which I had the pleasure and fun to learn how it works.

You might have the feeling of cheating for not written your webpages from scratch, but learning Bootstrap can help you to save time and energy.

As I started working with Bootstrap templates, I was surprised to see how functional webpage can be by just manipulating and adding components to the templates.

In the end, the webpages come out beautifully, with a carousel, navbar and banner working perfectly without much hassle. 

**Here are some steps you can follow so you can get started with Bootstrap:**

* Go to Bootstrap website http://getbootstrap.com/  and download the compiled file to your project folder and unzip the file Bootstrap (currently v3.3.7).

* Once the file is unzipped you should see the structure below. You can see it contains CSS, JS, fonts ans glyphicons.

```
bootstrap/
├── css/
│ ├── bootstrap.css
│ ├── bootstrap.css.map
│ ├── bootstrap.min.css
│ ├── bootstrap.min.css.map
│ ├── bootstrap-theme.css
│ ├── bootstrap-theme.css.map
│ ├── bootstrap-theme.min.css
│ └── bootstrap-theme.min.css.map
├── js/
│ ├── bootstrap.js
│ └── bootstrap.min.js
└── fonts/
├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot
├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg
├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf
├── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff
└── glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff2

source: bootstrap.com

```


* Next, copy the HTML template provided on the [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template) website and paste on your index.html file to begin working on your code. 


* You can customize the templates as you wish, but it's good not touch the prewritten folders that contains the CSS, JS and Glyphicons so you don't have problems down the road.

Once you get a hang of working with the Bootstrap templates it gets easier.  Using Bootstrap can save you time and can help you to create great galleries, responsive navbars and other great components. Doesn’t this make you super excited? I hope you have fun learning this framework like I did. 

I see you soon.

Tchau!
