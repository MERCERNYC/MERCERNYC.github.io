At some point in your life as a programmer, someone will tell you about a Hackathon. So here I am to tell you about my experience with my first Hackathon.  


I wish I had tried a hackathon earlier! I met amazing people and learned a ton.

I was always afraid in going to a Hackathon. I had this feeling of not being "good enough" and  that I wouldn't be able to execute a project well.  As I am in the end of my online program, I thought I needed a challenge, to challenge myself.

My first Hackaton was the [Angelhack](https://angelhack.com/global-hackathon-series/) that happened in New York.

I was so nervous that I arrived at the event very early. I thought I would be working on the challenges of the Hackathon alone.  Soon after I arrived, I met Ava. She was so nice that I asked her  if I could be part of her team.  
She was already with a group of 3. I was glad they were cool with me joining them. 

I didn't have a concrete idea which challenge we would go for.  There were challenges offered by many  sponsors including AWS, CITI, IBM and  AGORA.  We chose the  IBM challenge.

>  IBM challenge was a Code Global Challenge by building an application using cloud, data, analytics, AI, IoT, blockchain to improve natural disaster preparedness, response, or recovery focused on the health and well-being of individuals and communities.

Before starting coding, our team brainstomed for about  8 hours. Yep! 8 long hours of discussion, ideas and research in order to come up with a solution. On my team, I worked as a UI/UX Designer and  frontend developer;  even though, I have  no experience in UX. I worked closely with Alex,  a front-end developer,  to bulid the app with React. It is a language I am learning now. I was able to learn a lot with Alex and everything makes more sense to me now.

Our team created an app called RESP (RESPONSIVE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PROTOCOLS).

RESP is for first responders, providing effective, ethical mental health intervention in the immediate aftermath of a disaster and diagnostics for long-term prevention. Built with Django REST Framework and React with Machine Learning powered by IBM Watson and custom logistical regression classifiers trained on post-disaster psychiatric data.

We came up with this application based on a problem. 

> In the aftermath of natural disasters, the mental and emotional health of survivors  is overlooked and undercovered. ethical mental health intervention in the immediate aftermath of a disaster and diagnostics for long-term prevention.

And an amazing app was born. And guess what! **We won the IBM challenge.** We could't believe it! So many awesome projects were presented and we won the challenge.

For my first Hackathon, I am proud to have participated at AngelHack and to have worked with great people of different backgounds and experiences.
 
If you just started learning how to code, don't be afraid of going to a Hackathon. Instead, be prepared to meet many good people, learn new things, and have a lot of fun!
